# ElectricTransforming

This is a basic application to apply xsl transformations to XML files to allow people with low knowledge of shell or IDEs apply transformations.

For now is only a basic user interface where you select the xml file and the xslt file and do the process. When it finish processing the file then allows you to save the generated file.

## Usage

1. Select the XML file from your Hard Disk.
2. Select the XSLT file from your Hard Disk.
3. Process the XML.

## TODO List

1. Improve the UI
  * Allow to look at some directory workspace for files.
  * Improve design.
  * Allow to select a file or write a transformation file.
2. Clean trash files
  * Some files are generated as trash files and we must clean those files.
